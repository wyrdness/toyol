      "summary": "A toyol is an undead infant spirit used as a familiar in Malaysian and Indonesian black magic traditions. Created from dead fetuses or stillborn babies through necromantic rituals, toyols serve their masters by stealing money and valuables, causing mischief, and sometimes harming enemies.",
      "full": "The toyol (also spelled tuyul) is one of Southeast Asia's most feared supernatural entities—a reanimated infant corpse or spirit bound through black magic to serve a living master. Controlled by a bomoh (Malay shaman) or dukun (Indonesian practitioner), the toyol appears as a small, greenish-gray child with sharp teeth, red eyes, and either naked or dressed in green. These creatures are kept in earthenware jars, fed the blood of their master, and sent out at night to steal money, jewelry, and other valuables. The toyol operates as a supernatural servant, obeying commands but requiring constant care and feeding. While primarily associated with theft, toyols can also spy on enemies, cause illness, and create general mischief. The practice of keeping toyols is considered haram (forbidden) in Islam, yet belief in these entities remains widespread across Malaysia and Indonesia, appearing frequently in modern horror films and urban legends."
