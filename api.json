      "full": "The **toyol** (also spelled *tuyul*) is one of Southeast Asia's most infamous supernatural entities—an undead infant spirit bound through black magic to serve as a thieving familiar. These creatures, described as small, greenish-gray childlike beings with glowing red eyes and sharp teeth, are kept in earthenware jars and commanded to steal money and valuables for their masters. Created through necromantic rituals involving dead fetuses or stillborn babies, toyols represent a dark intersection of pre-Islamic animism, Islamic mysticism, and folk magic. Despite being considered *haram* (forbidden) in Islam, belief in toyols remains widespread across Malaysia and Indonesia, appearing in countless folk tales, horror films, and contemporary urban legends. The toyol serves as both supernatural servant and cautionary tale—promising wealth through forbidden means but ultimately bringing misfortune to those who keep them. These entities occupy a unique space in Malay culture: simultaneously feared, condemned by religious authorities, and deeply embedded in popular consciousness."
